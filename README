The following license is believed to be legally equivilent to the BSD, MIT, and ISC licenses. The text of the license was first written by Alexander E Genaud in 2005 ( http://genaud.net/2005/10/poetic-license/ ). Variations such as singular 'I' vs plural 'we' and a rearrangement of the final line are common. The license itself is in the public domain, though attribution to Alex Genaud is appreciated and expected by natural moral right.
